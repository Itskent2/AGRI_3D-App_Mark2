/**
 * @file agri3d_grbl.h
 * @brief GRBL/Nano serial bridge: non-blocking reader, adaptive status poll,
 *        Nano watchdog, GRBL status parser, machine dimension cache (NVS),
 *        and crash log parser.
 *
 * -- Machine Dimension Cache --
 * When the Nano reports $130/$131/$132 (after homing/auto-dim), the ESP32
 * stores those values in its own NVS (Preferences) so they survive reboots
 * and power cuts. On boot, the cached values are loaded immediately so the
 * ESP32 always knows the workspace size without waiting for a $$ query.
 *
 * -- Crash Log --
 * The Nano stores a 2-byte crash log in its EEPROM and replays it at boot
 * as "[PREVIOUS_CRASH:X:5,Y1:3]". The ESP32 captures this, stores it in
 * its own NVS, and broadcasts it to Flutter. The log is cleared by the Nano
 * only after a successful homing cycle.
 *
 * -- TMC Driver Telemetry --
 * The Nano includes "|TMC:0,0,0,0" in every status packet. The ESP32 parses
 * and stores this for Flutter's diagnostics panel.
