  // be also tracked, which will need to be kept at a system level. There are
  // likely some other things that will need to be tracked as well. However, we
  // feel that backlash compensation should NOT be handled by Grbl itself,
  // because there are a myriad of ways to implement it and can be effective or
  // ineffective for different CNC machines. This would be better handled by the
  // interface as a post-processor task, where the original g-code is translated
  // and inserts backlash motions that best suits the machine. NOTE: Perhaps as
  // a middle-ground, all that needs to be sent is a flag or special command
  // that indicates to Grbl what is a backlash compensation motion, so that Grbl
  // executes the move but doesn't update the machine position values. Since the
  // position values used by the g-code parser and planner are separate from the
